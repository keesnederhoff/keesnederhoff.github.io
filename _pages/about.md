I am a coastal scientist originally from the Netherlands and now based in the San Francisco Bay Area, where rising seas, urban estuaries, and ambitious adaptation plans intersect on the frontlines of climate change.

As a Coastal Scientist at Deltares USA and Visiting Scientist at the U.S. Geological Survey, I work with local, state, and federal partners to design actionable solutions that reduce coastal flood risks while protecting the natural systems that make our coastlines so valuable. My work bridges science, engineering, and decision-making — from major estuaries like San Francisco Bay and the Snohomish River to remote Arctic and tropical communities.

My research focuses on transforming how we predict and reduce coastal hazards under climate change, with three core themes:
Compound Flooding & Multi-Hazard Dynamics: Understanding how rivers, tides, surge, waves, and groundwater interact to shape flood extremes
Changing Hazard Regimes: Quantifying how climate change, sea-level rise, and permafrost thaw alter flood risk across diverse coastal systems
Nature-Based & Hybrid Adaptation:
Advancing engineering-grade modeling of wetlands, coral reefs, mangroves, and flood barrier systems to enhance community resilience

I hold a Ph.D. in Coastal Engineering (2024), along with M.S. and B.S. degrees in hydraulic engineering from TU Delft and IHE Delft. I collaborate widely across academia, government, and nonprofits, with >10 years of experience leading multi-investigator coastal resilience projects.

I am also passionate about teaching and mentoring. I have taught and led modeling workshops at UC Berkeley, UC Santa Cruz, TU Delft - helping the next generation of engineers build and troubleshoot real-world coastal models.

Outside of work, you’ll find me trail running in the East Bay hills, experimenting with drought-tolerant gardening, cooking new meals with my wife, or backpacking in the Sierra Nevada. These places remind me why resilience work matters — we are protecting both communities and the natural environments we love.
