abstract = {Abstract. Accurate flood risk assessments and early warning systems are needed to protect and prepare people in coastal areas from storms. In order to provide this information efficiently and on time, computational costs in flood models need to be kept as low as possible. One way to achieve this goal is to apply subgrid corrections to relatively coarse computational grids. Previously, these have been used in full-physics circulation models. In this paper, for the first time, we developed subgrid corrections for the linear inertial equations (LIEs) that account for bed level and friction variations. They were implemented in the Super-Fast INundation of CoastS (SFINCS) model version 2.1.1 Dollerup release. Pre-processed lookup tables that correlate water levels with hydrodynamic quantities make more precise simulations with lower computational costs possible. These subgrid corrections have undergone validation through several conceptual and real-world application scenarios, including rainfall-induced flooding during a hurricane and tidal propagation in an estuary. We demonstrate that the subgrid corrections for linear inertial equations significantly improve model accuracy while utilizing the same resolution without subgrid corrections. In terms of computational efficiency, subgrid corrections increase computational costs by 38 {\%}–128 {\%}. However, this yields a 35–50-time speedup since coarser model resolutions with subgrid corrections can provide the same accuracy as finer resolutions without subgrid corrections. Limitations are also discussed; for example, when grids do not adequately resolve river meanders, fluxes can be overestimated. Our findings show that subgrid corrections are a useful asset for hydrodynamic modelers striving to achieve a balance between accuracy and efficiency.},

abstract = {Compound coastal flooding due to astronomic, atmospheric, oceanographic, and hydrologic drivers poses severe threats to coastal communities. While physics-driven approaches are able to dynamically simulate temporally and spatially varying compound flooding generated by multiple drivers with correlations between some of them, computational burdens limit their capability to explore the full range of conditions that contribute to compound coastal hazards. Data-driven statistical approaches address some of these computational challenges; however, they are also unable to explore all possible forcing combinations due to short observational records, and projections are typically limited to a few locations. This study proposes a hybrid statistical–dynamical framework for compound coastal flooding analysis that integrates a stochastic generator of compound flooding drivers, a hydrodynamic model, and machine learning-based surrogate models. The framework was demonstrated in San Francisco Bay (SF) over the past 500 years with accuracy similar to the physics-driven approach but with much higher computational efficiency. The stochastic generator of compound flooding drivers is developed by coupling a sea surface temperature (SST) reconstruction model with a climate emulator, weather generator, and model of the hydrological and reservoir system. Using reconstructed SSTs as input, the generator of compound flooding drivers is employed to simulate time series of the forcing factors contributing to compound flooding (e.g. surge, waves, river discharge, etc) in SF Bay. A process-based hydrodynamic model is built to predict total water levels varying in time and space throughout SF Bay based on stochastically generated drivers. The machine learning-based surrogate models are then developed from a relatively small library (several hundred) of hydrodynamic model simulations to efficiently predict water levels for compound flooding analysis under the full range of stochastic drivers. This study contributes a hybrid statistical–dynamical framework to better understand the spatial distribution and temporal evolution of compound coastal-fluvial flooding, along with the relative contributions of drivers in complex nearshore, estuarine, and river environments for centennial timescales under past, present, and future climates.},

@article{Nederhoff2025,
abstract = {Hydrodynamic models are valuable tools for understanding the primary factors influencing daily and peak water levels and for guiding discussions on potential adaptation strategies for managing flood risk in coastal areas. This analysis uses the Delft3D San Francisco Bay-Delta Community Model to simulate water levels and incorporates the effects of a number of adaptation measures in the urban San Francisco Bay estuary, California. In particular, we examine the influence of shoreline hardening, nature-based solutions, and subre-gional floodgates on regional water levels. The result shows that under present conditions, tidal amplification is responsible for generating a wide distribution of extreme water levels across San Francisco Bay. Tidal amplification is found to decrease under sea level rise, thereby producing a relative damping effect on extremes. A comparison of different shoreline scenarios demonstrates that hard frontal shorelines result in higher tidal amplification, whereas restored (soft) shorelines lower amplification. The current shoreline configuration has both hard and soft characteristics and results in an intermediate tidal response. In some areas, wetland restoration reduces extreme water levels by as much as 20 cm, whereas hard-shoreline addition elevates them by as much as 10 cm for 1.5 m of sea level rise. Furthermore, local floodgates can significantly reduce high water levels without major adverse effects elsewhere in San Francisco Bay. These findings point toward the justification for a range of adaptive measures across political boundaries, weighing hard and soft options in addressing the mounting danger of sea level rise.. This work is made available under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International license, https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/. Practical Applications: Sea level rise and stronger storms are putting increasing pressure on coastal communities. In this study, we examined the effect of three different flood mitigation strategies, shoreline hardening, wetland restoration, and subregional floodgates, on water levels in San Francisco Bay, one of the country's most urbanized estuaries. Using a high-resolution hydrodynamic model, we examined how each of these actions affects extreme water levels under both present and future sea level rise scenarios. We found that building hard shorelines will raise water levels, while restoring wetlands will lower high water levels by as much as 20 cm in some areas. Local floodgates can also lower peak water levels without creating much disturbance in the area when they are reasonably situated and closed near slack tide. However, there are limits to each of these methods. Local adaptation can address flood risk up to approximately 1 m of SLR, but after that, in the 1.0-1.5-m range, low-lying areas start to get flooded more often, and larger, regional-scale measures become increasingly required. Overall, the findings suggest that a single strategy is unlikely to adequately address the region's changing flood risks. Mixing approaches may prove more effective, especially in diverse settings. They also point to the importance of coordination across jurisdictions to balance urban protection with ecosystem health and build long-term flood resilience in places like San Francisco Bay.},

abstract = {Subtropical coastlines are impacted by both tropical and extratropical cyclones. While both may lead to substantial damage to coastal communities, it is difficult to determine the contribution of tropical cyclones to coastal flooding relative to that of extratropical cyclones. We conduct a large-scale flood hazard and impact assessment across the subtropical Southeast Atlantic Coast of the United States, from Virginia to Florida, including different flood hazards. The physics-based hydrodynamic modeling skillfully reproduces coastal water levels based on a comprehensive validation of tides, almost two hundred historical storms, and an in-depth hindcast of Hurricane Florence. We show that yearly flood impacts are two times as likely to be driven by extratropical than tropical cyclones. On the other hand, tropical cyclones are 30 times more likely to affect people during rarer 100-year events than extratropical cyclones and contribute to more than half of the regional flood risk. With increasing sea levels, more areas will be flooded, regardless of whether flooding is driven by tropical or extratropical cyclones. Most of the absolute flood risk is contained in the greater Miami metropolitan area. However, several less populous counties have the highest relative risks. The results of this study provide critical information for understanding the source and frequency of compound flooding across the Southeast Atlantic Coast of the United States.},

abstract = {Accelerating sea level rise (SLR) and changing storm patterns will increasingly expose barrier islands to coastal hazards, including flooding, erosion, and rising groundwater tables. We assess the exposure of Cape Lookout National Seashore, a barrier island system in North Carolina (USA), to projected SLR and storm hazards over the twenty-first century. We estimate that with 0.5 m of SLR, 47{\%} of current subaerial barrier island area would be flooded daily, and the 1-year return period storm would flood 74{\%}. For 20-year return period storms, over 85{\%} is projected to be flooded for any SLR. The modelled groundwater table is already shallow ({\textless} 2 m deep), and while projected to shoal to the land surface with SLR, marine flooding is projected to overtake areas with emergent groundwater. Projected shoreline retreat reaches an average of 178 m with 1 m of SLR and no interventions, which is over 60{\%} of the current island width at narrower locations. Compounding these hazards is subsidence, with one-third of the study area currently lowering at {\textgreater} 2 mm/yr. Our results demonstrate the difficulty of managing natural barrier systems such as those managed by federal park systems tasked with maintaining natural ecosystems and protecting cultural resources.},

This research focuses on advancing robust and computationally efficient approaches to resolving the coastal compound flooding components for complex, estuary environments and their application to the Puget Sound region of Washington State (USA) and the greater Salish Sea. The modeling system provides coastal planners with projections of storm hazards and flood exposure for recurring flood events, spanning the annual to 1-percent annual chance of flooding, necessary to manage public safety and the prioritization and cost-efficient protection of critical infrastructure and valued ecosystems. The tool is applied and validated for Whatcom County, Washington, and includes a cross-shore profile model (XBeach) and overland flooding model (SFINCS) and is nested in a regional tide–surge model and wave model. Despite uncertainties in boundary conditions, hindcast simulations performed with the coupled model system accurately identified areas that were flooded during a recent storm in 2018. Flood hazards and risks are expected to increase exponentially as the sea level rises in the study area of 210 km of shoreline. With 1 m of sea-level rise, annual flood extents are projected to increase from 13 to 33 km2 (5 and 13{\%} of low-lying Whatcom County) and flood risk (defined in USD) is projected to increase fifteenfold (from 14 to USD 206 million). PS-CoSMoS, like its prior iteration in California (CoSMoS), provides valuable coastal hazard projections to help communities plan for the impacts of sea-level rise and storms.},

abstract = {Tropical cyclone impacts can have devastating effects on the population, infrastructure, and on natural habitats. 13 However, predicting these impacts is difficult due to the inherent uncertainties in the storm track and intensity. In addition, 14 due to computational constraints, both the relevant ocean physics and the uncertainties in meteorological forcing are only 15 partly accounted for. This paper presents a new method, called the Tropical Cyclone Forecasting Framework (TC-FF), to 16 probabilistically forecast compound flooding induced by tropical cyclones, considering uncertainties in track, forward speed, 17 and wind speed/intensity. The open-source method accounts for all major relevant physical drivers, including tide, surge, and 18 rainfall, and considers TC uncertainties through Gaussian error distributions and autoregressive techniques. The tool creates 19 temporally and spatially varying wind fields to force a computationally efficient compound flood model, allowing for the 20 computation of probabilistic wind and flood hazard maps for any oceanic basin in the world, as it does not require detailed 21 information on the distribution of historical errors. A comparison of TC-FF and JTWC operational ensembles, both based on 22 DeMaria et al. (2009), revealed minor differences of {\textless}10{\%}, suggesting that TC-FF can be employed as an alternative, for 23 example, in data-scarce environments. The method was applied to Cyclone Idai in Mozambique. The underlying physical 24 model showed reliable skill in terms of tidal propagation, reproducing the storm surge generation during landfall and flooding 25 near the city of Beira (success index of 0.59).

The case study analyzed needed at least 200 ensemble members to get reliable water levels and flood results three 27 days before landfall ({\textless}1{\%} flood probability error and {\textless}20 cm sampling errors).

abstract = {Extreme water-level recurrence estimates for a complex estuary using a high-resolution 2D model and a new method for estimating remotely generated sea level anomalies (SLAs) at the model boundary have been developed. The hydrodynamic model accurately resolves the dominant physical processes contributing to extreme water levels across the Washington State waters of the Salish Sea, including the relative contribution of remote SLA and other non-tidal residual processes that drive extreme water levels above the predicted tide. The model's predictions have errors of less than 15 cm ({\textless}5{\%} of 3–4 m tidal range) at eight tide gauge locations across the model domain. The influence of remote SLAs at the seaward boundary of the model was implemented using a multivariate regression of readily available and locally relevant wind, sea surface temperature, and pressure anomaly data, combined with El Ni{\~{n}}o Index data (R2 = 0.76). The hydrodynamic model simulations using the remote SLA predictor compared well with simulations using the widely used data-assimilative global ocean model HYCOM SLA data (root mean square difference of 5.5 cm). Extreme water-level recurrence estimates with and without remote SLA show that remote forcing accounts for 50–60{\%} of the total water level anomaly observed along Salish Sea shorelines. The resulting model simulations across decadal timescales provide estimates of extreme water level recurrence across the Salish Sea, capturing climate variability important to long-term coastal hazard planning. This approach has widespread applications for other complex estuarine systems.},

abstract = {A 2-layer non-hydrostatic model with improved dispersive behaviour is presented. Due to the assumption of a constant non-hydrostatic pressure distribution in the lower layer, the dispersive behaviour is improved without much additional computational time. A comparison with linear wave theory showed that this 2-layer model gives a better result for the dispersion relation and shoaling of waves in intermediate water. This means that the 2-layer model is applicable in shallow and intermediate water depths (up to relative depths kh equals 4), whereas the 1-layer model is only applicable in shallow water depths (kh smaller than 1). Three laboratory experiments, including a fringing reef and a barred beach, were used to validate the presented mode for different hydrodynamic conditions. Based on these results, it can be concluded that the 2-layer model can be applied to accurately simulate the bulk wave height and spectral properties. The low frequency wave height, the setup and in particular the second order statistics contain more scatter, but the model accurately captured the general trend. Furthermore, the model showed good results for complex bathymetries in shallow to intermediate water.},

abstract = {SFINCS, a new reduced-physics solver to compute compound flooding in coastal systems due to fluvial, pluvial, tidal, wind- and wave-driven processes in a computationally efficient way, is presented and validated for a number of verification and application cases. The model solves simplified equations of mass and momentum, which are driven by storm surge and wave boundary conditions, precipitation rates and upstream river discharges. It includes spatially-varying infiltration and bed roughness terms as well as an absorbing-generating seaward boundary to enable wave-driven flooding. Furthermore, advection and wind stress terms can be included. We demonstrate for the application case of hurricane impact on Jacksonville (Florida, USA) that the observed flooding was a combination of fluvial, pluvial, tidal and wind-driven flooding and that this can be modeled well using the reduced-physics solver. We show that the addition of an advection term to the momentum equations is necessary to model shock flows such as dam breaks but also incident broken waves. Thus, wave-driven flooding can be modeled with high computational efficiency and adequate accuracy as demonstrated for the case of Hernani (the Philippines). The model results show the potential of achieving good accuracy at limited computational expense.},

abstract = {The open-source program Delft Dashboard (DDB) is a graphical user interface designed to quickly create, edit input parameters and visualize model inputs for a number of hydrodynamic models, using private or publicly available local and global datasets. It includes a number of toolboxes that facilitate the generation of spatially varying inputs. These include new model schematizations (grids, bathymetry, boundary conditions, etc.), cyclonic wind fields and initial tsunami waves. The use of DDB can have significant benefits. It can save modellers considerable time and effort. Furthermore, the automated nature of both data collection and pre-processing within the program reduces the likelihood of errors that could occur when setting up models manually. Three case studies are presented: simulation of tides in the North Sea, storm surge and wave modelling under tropical cyclone conditions and the simulation of a tsunami. The test cases show that models created with DDB can be set up efficiently while maintaining a predictive skill that is only slightly lower than that of extensively calibrated models.},

@article{Tehranirad2020,
abstract = {Accurate and timely flood forecasts are critical for making emergency-response decisions regarding public safety, infrastructure operations, and resource allocation. One of the main challenges for coastal flood forecasting systems is a lack of reliable forecast data of large-scale oceanic and watershed processes and the combined effects of multiple hazards, such as compound flooding at river mouths. Offshore water level anomalies, known as remote Non-Tidal Residuals (NTRs), are caused by processes such as downwelling, offshore wind setup, and also driven by ocean-basin salinity and temperature changes, common along the west coast during El Ni{\~{n}}o events. Similarly, fluvial discharges can contribute to extreme water levels in the coastal area, while they are dominated by large-scale watershed hydraulics. However, with the recent emergence of reliable large-scale forecast systems, coastal models now import the essential input data to forecast extreme water levels in the nearshore. Accordingly, we have developed Hydro-CoSMoS, a new coastal forecast model based on the USGS Coastal Storm Modeling System (CoSMoS) powered by the Delft3D San Francisco Bay and Delta community model. In this work, we studied the role of fluvial discharges and remote NTRs on extreme water levels during a February 2019 storm by using Hydro-CoSMoS in hindcast mode. We simulated the storm with and without real-time fluvial discharge data to study their effect on coastal water levels and flooding extent, and highlight the importance of watershed forecast systems such as NOAA's National Water Model (NWM). We also studied the effect of remote NTRs on coastal water levels in San Francisco Bay during the 2019 February storm by utilizing the data from a global ocean model (HYCOM). Our results showed that accurate forecasts of remote NTRs and fluvial discharges can play a significant role in predicting extreme water levels in San Francisco Bay. This pilot application in San Francisco Bay can serve as a basis for integrated coastal flood modeling systems in complex coastal settings worldwide.},
